Data cleaning: 
Prof.Alexander first set up a dictionary and mutated some variables and the values to be easier to work with. 
 ## 1. The process converted numerical response that represent a categorical value into the real responses. 
 ## 2. The dictionary then is applied to the raw data. 
 ## 3. String variables are also changed in to numerical values. For example, 'one' is changed to 1, 'two' is changed to 2, etc. 
 ## 4. The output of the cleaned data is called gss.csv, which will be used in the paper.
