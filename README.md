Data cleaning: Prof.Alexander first set up a dictionary and mutated some variables and the values to be easier to work with.

The process converted numerical response that represent a categorical value into the real responses.
The dictionary then is applied to the raw data.
String variables are also changed in to numerical values. For example, 'one' is changed to 1, 'two' is changed to 2, etc.
The output of the cleaned data is called gss.csv, which will be used in the paper.
